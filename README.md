ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I am a web programming student at Blekinge Institute of Technology and will graduate in June 2023. My goal is to become a fullstack developer, and I'm always working on improving my skills.

ðŸš€ I am excited to share my group project "Spark" with you, which is an electric scooter system with a database, two web clients, a web app, and an API, as well as a simulation for the system. You can find the code for the project at https://github.com/Spark-Vteam/Spark-Project.

ðŸ’» I have experience with web development technologies such as React, TypeScript, Node.js, Python, Php and more. I'm always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow as a developer.

:school: I am currently working on my thesis project in the area of "green coding," which explores methods for developing software that is more environmentally friendly and reduces energy consumption.
